## General suggestions

**Don't** use

- words that can be found in dictionaries e.g. 'Lemon' or 'love'
- simple passwords e.g. '12345', 'aaaaaa', '1234abcd' or 'password'
- something that could be guessed from your social media profiles e.g. your dog's name or your birthday
- the same password on different websites e.g. on Facebook and Twitter
- context-specific words e.g. 'instagram-ILOVEyou' on Instagram
- physical notebooks or unsecured files, software to store your passwords

**Do** use

- at least eight characters (but ideally more)
- a mix of characters: 
  - capital letters e.g. 'C' (perhaps not the first letter in your password as it is too common)
  - lower case letters e.g. 'w'
  - numbers e.g. '7' or '75'
  - symbols e.g. '<', '+', '>' (some platforms prohibit certain characters)
- try a twist on a personal affirmation (e.g. Dontevergiveupmyfr1end!667)
- if possible, consider enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA) and biometric verification as they add extra layers of security 
- use a trustworthy password manager app e.g. [Enpass](https://www.enpass.io/) and use very strong master password for it

## Length vs complexity
### Length is important
- Longer passwords inherently have more combinations, making them more resilient against brute-force attacks.
- Long phrases or sentences are more user-friendly.

### But complexity matters too
- Incorporating a mix of uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols enhances resistance not only against dictionary attacks, but also ['smart' brute-force attacks](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/learn/brute-force-attacks.html) AKA mask attacks, which apply patterns, rules, or masks based on common words, phrases, or structures. 
- Still, avoid making passwords too complex to remember.

Both length and complexity are crucial aspects of a strong password, and finding the right balance between the two can enhance password security significantly. Here’s a breakdown:

#### Length
Advantages: Longer passwords increase the number of possible combinations, making brute-force attacks more difficult. It allows for the usage of phrases or sentences that might be easier to remember.
    
Disadvantages: Extremely long passwords can be cumbersome to enter, especially on mobile devices or platforms that log users out frequently.

#### Complexity
Advantages: Adding a mix of uppercase letters, numbers, and special symbols makes the password harder to guess, providing resistance against dictionary and brute-force attacks.

Disadvantages: Complex passwords can be challenging to remember, leading users to either write them down or use password managers, which might also have vulnerabilities.

#### Combining length and complexity
Utilizing a passphrase with mixed-case letters, numbers, and special characters offers an effective blend of length and complexity. Such a password remains resistant to a wide array of attacks, including brute-force, dictionary, and rainbow table attacks.

#### Conclusion
Combining length and complexity doesn’t necessarily mean having a complicated password that is hard to remember. Using easy-to-recall phrases, substituting letters with numbers or symbols, and adding variation in letter casing can make passwords both secure and user-friendly. Remember, no approach is foolproof, and enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA) where possible adds an extra layer of security.

## An idea for creating strong passwords
Create a base phrase and add service-specific modifiers:

1. Base: `going2uniIZgreatfunin2023`
2. For Facebook: `FK_going2uniIZgreatfunin2023`
3. For ResearchGate: `going2uniIZgreatfunin2023:re`

Bare in mind that different services have different requirements for password composition. For instance, while some allow the character ':' some don't. 

## Testing your password strategy
Evaluate your strategy using online tools like [howsecureismypassword.net](https://howsecureismypassword.net/). Avoid testing your actual passwords; instead, evaluate the methodology (your pattern).

## Considerations
Consider simplifying your digital presence by minimizing the number of accounts where possible.
