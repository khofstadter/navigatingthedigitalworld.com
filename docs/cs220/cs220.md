# CS220 modules at Essex
This page informs you about how to use this website for the CS220 modules run at the University of Essex's Interdisciplinary Studies Centre (ISC) that resides in the School of Philosophy and Art History (SPAH). In essence, there are two modules; CS220AU for the Autumn term and CS220SP for the Spring term. If your module code is CS220FY, then FY means 'full' and you enrolled in both, the AU and SP modules.
