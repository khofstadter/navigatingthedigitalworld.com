# Digital Heritage

## Literature
The Language of New Media (2001) Manovich

How we transcoding is important
- data is never neutral (e.g. Alexa had only a female voice and had to be talked to very directly)

Norman Wilson 2012 Digital Work
- fingerprints were linked to black people (he was fired after the publication of this paper)

We need minerals (96% of market come from China); in primarily from Bayan Obo (50%).

Richardson (?) All Watch Over by Machines of Loving Grace talks about environmental; equity, inclusion, etc. (14:10)

## Digital Heritage
Tech is used for many things. 

The essence has both (tangible and intangible)

- Tangible: statues, etc.  
- Intangible: language, local customs, religion, how food is made.

### Tech used for DI pro:
Capture imagination, creativity. 
Helps dissemination. 
Opens discussion.
Helps multi-vocality. 
Date precisions. 

### cons: 
- needs expertise
- longevity needs to be address as formats and how things are decoded (played) change. 
- ethics, ...

## layers
- [[[local]national]global]]] e.g. Italian and Chicago pizza

Heritage is not a thing but a process. Heritage is not just about the past, it's about how it links to the past. 

Also, London is a national heritage as it links to all cultures in London (despite ethnic groups).

## MacCannell (?) The Tourist 
- people (tourists) are looking for something authentic (state authenticity (links to branding) because tourists expect it (food, music, table cover, etc.)


## Boudrillard (nd) Simularcra and Simulation
- simulation tries to capture reality

## 3D, VR worlds
- the way music is used is also a question

## Accessibility examples
- a painting can also (now with tech) be 3D printed 

## Emerging question
- Why is it important to better experience the past and then as part of this experience link it to the present moment? 
- For whom
  - For tourists to experience something new. 
  - For researchers to immerse/engage with data to better understand their own research. 

## Digital colonialism
- she gave us two examples

## Random
- dig tech can reach new audiences (younger with video games and comics, for more scholarly orientated the can go to databases)
- pre, in and post visit experiences
- the traditional sense of preserving heritage in museums has shifted and we are moving towards a more digital way or presenting it. <!--PF-->
- history can help you to remember the past and not make the same mistakes
