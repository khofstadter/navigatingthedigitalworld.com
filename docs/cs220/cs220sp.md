## Module description
This page expands on the university's [module descriptions](https://github.com/khofstadter/CS220AU-DP/tree/main/assets).

The Module Director organizes weekly sessions for weeks 16–20 and 22–25. Each session consists of a one-hour lecture plus a one-hour seminar for discussion. The lectures are given by different experts on a specific topic linked to the module (e.g., digital heritage, social networks, gender inequality, video games and cybercrime). 

## Assignment
### Brief and research domains
Throughout the term, you will be asked to choose a research question from a given list (see below) and answer it in written form (i.e., in an essay). By your deadline, you will need to submit your essay using an [accessible PDF](https://www.adobe.com/acrobat/hub/what-is-an-accessible-pdf.html) file on FASER.

The list of research questions you must choose from for your essay:

- How does social media impact self-representation and identity?
- What is the importance of social networks?
- Are digital technologies a threat to democracy?
- To what extent do hackers represent a threat and/or an opportunity for democracy?
- What is the relationship between open science and the democratization of e-knowledge?
- How is AI impacting education?
- Why does the digital world need to be gendered?
- To what extent is online surveillance a 'necessary evil'?
- How can we use digital technologies to protect and promote human rights and justice?
- What are the legal and political aspects of cybercrime?

Other research questions are possible, however will need to be discussed with the module director.
