## Literature
Haselby, Sam 2023 **The polycrisis: Is this the word we need to describe unprecedented convergences between ecological, political and economic strife?** Essay available on [AEON](https://aeon.co/essays/the-case-for-polycrisis-as-a-keyword-of-our-interconnected-times?utm_source=pocket-newtab-en-gb).

Schmachtenberger, Daniel 2023 **An introduction to the Metacrisis** at Stockholm Impact Week 2023. Video available on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/4kBoLVvoqVY?feature=shared). 
- Quick notes: Daniel talks about ther metacrisis, AI, the effects of globalization after WWII, and more. His message is depressing, but he is perfectly fine with it. He wants you to start by feeling depressed. Not feeling depressed means you haven't recognized the "continued destruction of the sacred around us" (e.g., sex trafficking of children or factory farming of animals). He offers a silver lining: Don't wait for others to address issues; take action yourself, which will alleviate your depression. I think he used the "f" word only five times.

More to come ...
