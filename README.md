# Navigating the Digital World
## Tasks

### by week 4 (apm)
1. refine up project management and highlight most useful parts for this year's students. We talked about time keeping, setting a couple of hours aside a week for this module, how to concentrate, etc. now put this into a bigger picture, system: the project management system. Perhaps make the seminar more practical, similarly to the GitHub Pages setup as it generated energy and momentum for the whole class.
   - add jiscmail mailinglists to APM outline
2. email students about setting up their own group
3. email Kathryn: 
   - what ethics form do we need to deal with if students want to run a survey?

   1. link with them on LinkedIn

   1. Google Docs, etc. 
   2. Microsoft
   3. Dropbox, etc. 
6. handwriting vs typing notes (find REFs)

## Log
2023-10-19 Revised password-management and your-website pages. Decided to keep the list (notes) form for seminars as they are more useful when talking to people than the written up prose. (Don't read sentences while presenting, especially when your audience can read them as well.) It would be best to write up the lists (notes) into prose after the seminars for students to have a better flow when they revisit the site (and for those who didn't make it to the class), but keep the lists (notes) in HTML comments for next year. This might also be useful for recontextualizing a page for another platform e.g. Medium.

2023-10-12 Refined digital-identities page and added missing files from previous repo.

2023-10-11 Refined template repository. In this repo, I added general info to home page, and refined the page for the overall CS220 file. Also updated the repository with `bundle update` via macOS Terminal.

2023-08-22 Installed Jekyll on macOS 13.5, cloned/forked (?) Just The Docs template via browser, cloned repo on localhost (laptop), installed missing Ruby gems separately with source being `https://gems.ruby-china.com` in the Gemfile, as bundle didn't work. More info in `notes\projects\ndw.md` in private repo.
