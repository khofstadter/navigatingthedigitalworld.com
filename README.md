## Log
2023-10-11 Refined template repository. In this repo, I added general info to home page, and refined the page for the overall CS220 file. Also updated the repository with `bundle update` via macOS Terminal.

2023-08-22 Installed Jekyll on macOS 13.5, cloned/forked (?) Just The Docs template via browser, cloned repo on localhost (laptop), installed missing Ruby gems separately with source being `https://gems.ruby-china.com` in the Gemfile, as bundle didn't work. More info in `notes\projects\ndw.md` in private repo.
