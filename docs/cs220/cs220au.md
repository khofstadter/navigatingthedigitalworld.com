## CS220AU timetable
Group 1: Fri 12–2pm in IT Lab I 3.402   
Group 2: Fri 4-6pm in IT Lab J 4SB.4.14

We have two-hour sessions in [weeks 2–7, 9–11](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/timetables/). 

Week 8 is reading week (no classes).

## Module description
This page expands on the university's [module descriptions](https://github.com/khofstadter/CS220AU-DP/tree/main/assets).

After a one-hour session introducing both parts of the module in week 2, the seminars/workshops in weeks 2–7 provide training in a specific topic such, as <!-- can these be tags that we could click on? Also, shouldn't this be organized in the order of the syllabus? -->

- digital identities
- web design
- multimedia production
- e-safety
- blogging
- intelligent search strategies
- note-taking
- digital writing skills
- agile project management

Workshops in weeks 9–11 provide opportunities to present your progress for feedback.

`progress = happiness` :)

The module introduces primarily free and cross-platform software, often highlighting their advantages and disadvantages compared to paid software.

The classes run in labs equipped with Windows PCs, providing some tools to help build your portfolios. I will also demonstrate software on macOS. You can use your own laptops and software in class.

## Assignment brief
Throughout the term, you will build a digital portfolio that consists of

1. a website critically reflecting on a specific connection between two research domains
   - digital identities <!-- add link to page -->
   - existential risks <!-- add link to page -->
2. a self- and peer-assessment file
3. a succinct portfolio overview

For more information, see the [digital portfolio template](https://github.com/khofstadter/CS220AU-DP).

<!-- can I add a venn diagramm here with code? -->

You are asked to
1. explore connections between digital identities and existential risks
2. choose one specific connection
3. use your website to critically reflect one this connection

Your need to
1. review the literature
2. analyze your findings
3. synthesize them 
4. publish the result

<!-- 
Research question ideas: 
- How are my digital identities connected to an existential risk? Or more specifically, how is the digital identity I use in my visiting/resident mode connected to an existential risk?
- How can I improve my professional digital identity to help myself and others better understand an existential risk?
- How are the digital identities used by a specific demographics connected to an existential risks? 
- How can I interpret data linked to an existential risk and use my digital identity (or identities) to effectively communicate my findings?
- How have the link between digital identities and existential risks been communicated in films? For instance AI with Terminator (1984), Her, Blade Runner. Bioweapons with 12 Monkeys, zombie movies. Global warming with Interstellar, new movie with Di Caprio. This could be an overview of films linked to DI and ER or perhaps a comparision of two movies. What about the Black Mirror series or similar series e.g. listed on https://screenrant.com/shows-like-black-mirror-netflix/. 
- How have the link between digital identities and existential risks been communicated in novels?
- How could we link terrorism to the theme? 
- How can the Ukrainian war be connected to DI (and ER) e.g. live reporting via social media? 
- Is there a difference between how to demographic groups use their digital identies in consuming and sharing ideas about ERs? 
- Link between DI vs energy consumptions. 
- Link between DI and misinformation. 
- War games (DI) and war (ER). Film: Gamer.

1. White et al.'s [Visitor & Resident (V&R) method](digital-identities.md/#visitors-and-residents) (see figure 1. below)
2. tools for project management, web design and hosting as well as content production
3. additional methods for sensemaking

While this module primarily focuses on providing practical skills, it also opens up dialogues to help develop critical thinking about our digital identities and interactions e.g. by asking the following questions:

- how are we currently engaging with the Web, and how can we improve this?
- how can we develop and use our online identities e.g. with our own websites for 'better' engagement?
- what does 'better' engagement actually mean and how can we relate it to problem-solving?
- how can we use software tools to produce content e.g. audio-video materials, to help disseminate information via our online identities more effectively?
- how can we apply critical thinking regarding the information we consume and produce?
- why should we produce information and whom should we address with this information i.e. who is our target audience?
- what is the change we would like to see in the world and how can we use our resident identities on the Web to support this change?

### Digital portfolio examples
Examples from last year's CS220AU portfolios can be found [here](https://github.com/khofstadter/CS220AU-DP/forks).

## Syllabus with notes
This outline is subject to change based on our progress.

From week 3 onwards, each session will start with shortly discussing your progress. 

### w2 Intro + digital identities (VR map)
- you are free to leave the room anytime (toilet, fresh air)
- we can have a 10 min break in the middle
- we must leave the room 10 min before the next class starts
- who has a class to catch after this?
- next, let's revise this page from the top to help clarify what the digital portfolio and the research question are

### FAQ
Can I develop a website with another software e.g. WordPress, Wix, Squarespace, etc?
- No, GitHub is free, fast, and will provide you with a better understanding of the foundations of the digital world (e.g. the relationship between back-end and the front-end of a website).

Why do I need to write up my thoughts on a website instead of in 'normal' essay in a Word file? 
- Because, writing something public will push you to work harder. 
- Because, making a website will develop new skills (e.g. the basic understanding of web-design and hosting).
- Because, you can embed audio-visual content in a website. 
- Because, you can share it faster. 
- You can stay anonymous, if you want to.

Is this module for me?
- In essence, the module can help you
  - develop your digital identities, but more specifically your professional digital identity (i.e. your professional engagement with others through the Web)
  - understand basic web-design and content production and provide you with a very fast website (for free).

Now, let's find out how we can assess our digital identities, our engagement with the Web. <!-- #todo add link to page -->

<!-- 
### homework
#### part 1 (digital identities)
- finish watching the V&R videos (if we haven't in class) and make sure you take notes 
- check the examples on White’s [website](http://daveowhite.com/vandr/vr-mapping/)
- explore the links under the 'further resources' heading in the [digital identities](digital-identities.md) file
- start drafting your own V&R map to help understand how you can develop your professional digital identity and be more mindful with how you use the Net

#### part 2 (existential risks)
- do some initial literature research on existential risks (e.g. find out what they are)
- find out what risk you are most interested in and try to link it with digital identities

#### part 3 (critical thinking)
-  do some initial literature research on critical thinking

#### part 4 (your group)
- consider creating an online group for yourself where you can discuss module related questions without me/university monitoring it (e.g. on WhatsUp, Viber, Facebook)

#### part 5 (digital portfolio, website)
- don't worry about the digital portfolio, and the website for now. We will set them up next week together. 

Find out how much people can see of your social media activities.

### w3 Websites, digital portfolio setup (GitHub, Markdown)
#### intro
- how do you take notes?
- GitHub account and repositories
- Markdown language

1. do you need clarification on the assignment?
2. any other questions (e.g. coming to the evening class?)
3. did you manage to finish watching/reading the info on the di page?
4. did you manage to write up your notes? 
5. where are your notes now? What format? 
6. have you managed to create an online group for yourselves to discuss ideas freely?

#### today
Today we will
1. talk a bit about websites
2. password
3. create a GitHub account with two repositories (aka repos)
  - one private (you can use it for your notes)
  - one public (you will have to use it for your assignment)
- start the ‘log’ and the ‘TODO’ lists in your portfolios
- use the GitHub Pages function in your repositories' settings to turn Markdown files into HTML (to create your website)
--> 

<!--
### homework ideas
- start using your repositories and get familiar with Markdown language
- add notes to your `inbox` folder (private repo) and find time to rewrite them into atomic notes in your `permanent` folder. Then start creating a narrative in a file (or files) in the `project` folder and reference the atomic notes in these project files. These project files, once refined, will be added to your other repository, the digital portfolio to be used as website pages or blog posts.
- once you have a good draft, we will move this draft to the public repository
- carry on developing a research question (or questions) for your website
- as an experiment, try [Brave Browser](https://brave.com/) for a week, to see what data websites are trying to crawl from you (data mining). Also, you can use this browser with YouTube or Spotify to get rid of all ads. Please try! It's great!
