The Module Director organizes weekly sessions for weeks 16–22 and 24–25. Each session consists of a one-hour lecture plus a one-hour seminar for discussion. The lectures are given by different experts on a specific topic linked to the module (e.g., digital heritage, social networks, gender inequality, video games and cybercrime). 

## Assignment

Throughout the term, you will be asked to choose a research question from a given list (see below) and answer it in written form (i.e., in an essay).
