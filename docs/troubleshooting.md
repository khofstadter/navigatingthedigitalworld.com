Where, when and how to ask for help e.g. in person, in an email or via an online forum/group?

1. what are the keywords you need to describe your problem?
2. try your best with the information provided in the help files/FAQ to solve your problem
3. use the keywords in relevant forums/groups to see whether anyone had the same or similar problems earlier 
4. ask a question (be concise and friendly)
  1. state the problem 
  2. state what you have done (e.g. searched the forum but didn't find anything helpful)

## thoughts
- DIY vs asking for help (perhaps paying someone for help)
- long term vs short term benefits
