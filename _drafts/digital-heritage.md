# Digital Heritage

## Literature
The Language of New Media (2001) Manovich <!-- to sum-->

How we transcoding is important is never neutral (e.g. Alexa had only a female voice and had to be talked to very directly).<!-- link to RQ7.> 

Norman Wilson 2012 Digital Work in which fingerprints were linked to people of color (he was fired after the publication of this paper). <!-- maybe link to RQ9 to highlight a problem -->

We need minerals (96% of market come from China); in primarily from Bayan Obo (50%). <!-- maybe link to RQ9 to highlight a problem -->

Richardson (?) All Watch Over by Machines of Loving Grace talks about environmental; equity, inclusion, etc. (14:10) <!-- check -->

## Digital Heritage (DH)
Tech is used for many things. 

The essence has both (tangible and intangible)

- Tangible: statues, etc.  
- Intangible: language, local customs, religion, how food is made.

### Pros and cons of tech used for DH
pros: <!-- linked to RQ6 as DH (which uses AI) is used for education -->
Capture imagination, creativity. 
Helps dissemination. 
Opens discussion.
Helps multi-vocality. 
Date precisions. 

cons: 
- needs expertise
- longevity needs to be addressed as formats and how things are decoded (played) change. 
- ethics, ...

## Layers
[[[local]national]global]]] e.g. Italian and Chicago pizza <!-- link to RQ1 (identity), to RQ2 (different layers of social networks (discuss local things, discuss national things, discuss ...) also to RQ9 maybe as identity is perhaps linked to human rights and justice -->

Heritage is not a thing but a process. Heritage is not just about the past, it's about how it links to the past to teach us about making decisions in the present. <!-- RQ9 -->

Also, London is a national heritage as it links to all cultures in London (despite ethnic groups).

## Staged Authenticity
MacCannell (?) The Tourist : people (tourists) are looking for something authentic (state authenticity (links to branding) because tourists expect it (food, music, table cover, etc.) <!-- RQ1 because maybe social media reinforces stereotypes (identities in a specific culture). Are we force to behave in certain ways (represent our selves, to be validated (paid attention to). Why is others' paying attention to us so important? Is it survival e.g. in case of the restaurants or on the other end greed? -->

## Boudrillard (nd) Simularcra and Simulation
- simulation tries to capture reality

## 3D, VR worlds
- the way music is used is also a question

## Accessibility examples
- a painting can also (now with tech) be 3D printed <!-- could be a new linked to a new research question exploring the connection between the digital world (tech) and accessibility --> 

## Ethical issues with reproducing heritage
- Syrian arch (damaged by ISIS) reproduced (AFAIK not involving the Syrians in the project) <!-- vaguely linked to RQ3 (democracy - as they didn't ask the Syrians), could be an example for RQ9-->
- Palmyra3dmodel (through social media) actively involving the public in AFAIR sourcing assets or contributing with code (if they can) <!-- RQ1, RQ2, RQ5 -->

## Emerging question
- Why is it important to better experience the past and then as part of this experience link it to the present moment? 
- For whom
  - For tourists to experience something new. 
  - For researchers to immerse/engage with data to better understand their own research. 

## Digital colonialism
- she gave us two examples

## Random
- dig tech can reach new audiences (younger with video games and comics, for more scholarly orientated the can go to databases)
- pre, in and post visit experiences
- the traditional sense of preserving heritage in museums has shifted and we are moving towards a more digital way or presenting it. <!--PF-->
- history can help you to remember the past and not make the same mistakes

## glass-case effect, disconnected communities
At these sites, it's too expensive for locals to visit their own heritage: 
- Mogao's Grotto
- Hierapolis, Pamukkale, Greece
