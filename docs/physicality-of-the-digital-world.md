## Introduction

In today's world, we are surrounded by digital technology in almost every aspect of our lives. From smartphones to laptops, from social media to online banking, from remote working to e-learning – digital technology has become an integral part of our daily routines. 

What exactly makes up this 'digital world'? What is its physical essence?

When we talk about the 'digital world', it's easy to imagine it as a sort of ethereal, otherworldly dimension that exists separately from our physical reality. A realm where information flows freely, unhindered by physical constraints. However, the truth is far from this. The digital world is deeply rooted in the physical world. It is built on tangible, material infrastructure - servers, data centers, fiber optic cables, and more.

Understanding the physicality of the digital world is crucial. It helps us grasp how the internet works, how data travels, how devices communicate, and ultimately, how our actions in the digital space can have real-world consequences. This understanding also sheds light on the environmental impact of our digital activities, the geopolitics of internet access, and the societal implications of digital technologies.

This page delves into the history of the internet, the physical components that make up the digital world, the energy consumption and environmental impacts, issues of ownership and control, risks and threats, surveillance and privacy concerns, and the dominant languages of the internet.

This page should set the stage for the rest of the presentations in this module, each of which will delve deeper into specific aspects of our digital lives.

## Human Communication

The table below provides an overview of various communication methods along with their characteristics. It classifies each method based on the type of communication (mental, physical, digital, analogue), whether it's verbal or non-verbal, the mode of communication (in-person, remote), and the direction of communication (one-way, two-way, mass communication).

| Examples | Type | Verbal/Non-Verbal | Communication Mode | Communication Direction |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Conversation in a Cafe | Physical | Both | In Person (real-time) | Two-way (Interpersonal) |
| Self-talk | Mental | Both | In Person (real-time) | One-way (Intrapersonal[^schizophrenia]) |
| Journaling | Physical/Digital | Verbal | In Person (real-time) | One-way (Intrapersonal) |
| Mail/Email | Physical/Digital | Verbal | Remote (non-real-time) | Two-way (Interpersonal) |
| Print Media (Books, Newspapers) | Physical | Verbal | Remote (non-real-time) | Mass Communication |
| Television | Analogue/Digital | Both | Remote (real-time) | Mass Communication |
| Radio | Analogue/Digital | Verbal | Remote (real-time) | Mass Communication |
| Telephone | Analogue/Digital | Verbal | Remote (real-time) | Two-way (Interpersonal) |
| Video Calls e.g. Skype, Zoom | Digital | Verbal | Remote (real-time) | Two-way (Interpersonal) |
| Social Media (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram) | Digital | Both | Remote (real-time)/Remote (non-real-time) | Mass Communication |

[^schizophrenia]: Might be different with schizophrenia or Jungian dreamwork. 

Analogue signals are continuous signal which represent physical measurements. They use a physical quantity like electrical voltage to represent information. The changes in the signal are smooth and span a large set of values. For example, the sound in a room, the light intensity from a lamp, or the temperature of a room are all analogue signals as they can be measured on a continuous scale. Digital signals are discrete time signals generated by digital modulation. These signals are non-continuous and represent information as a sequence of distinct values. These signals are characterized by ones and zeros, also known as binary code. Each one or zero is referred to as a bit, and a combination of bits makes a byte. 

![Figure comparing analogue and digital signals.](https://assets.klipsch.com/blog-assets/Digital-and-Analog-Wave.jpg)

The **digital world is created from digits** rather than analogue signals for several key reasons:

1. Precision and Accuracy: Digital data can be reproduced exactly, while analog data is subject to slight variations.

2. Noise Resistance: Digital signals are less susceptible to noise or interference compared to analogue signals. Even if a digital signal is corrupted, as long as the corruption is not too severe, the original data can still be accurately reconstructed.

3. Ease of Processing: Digital data can be easily processed and manipulated by computers and other digital devices.

4. Storage and Transmission: Digital data can be stored and transmitted more efficiently and securely than analog data. It's also easier to make multiple copies of digital data without losing quality.

Here's a simple comparison in code:

```
# Analog Data
analog_data = 0.5736 # This could vary slightly each time it's measured

# Digital Data
digital_data = 0 # It's either 0 or 1, no in-between

```

**The digital world is intricately connected to the Internet** in multiple ways. Here are some key points:

1. Information Exchange: The Internet serves as a global platform for exchanging digital information. This includes everything from emails and web pages, to streaming videos and online gaming.

2. Cloud Computing: Many digital services leverage the power of the Internet to provide cloud-based solutions. These services range from data storage and backup, to running complex applications.

3. Connectivity: The Internet connects digital devices around the world, enabling communication, collaboration, and sharing of resources.

4. IoT (Internet of Things): In the modern digital world, not only computers and smartphones, but also many everyday objects like cars, home appliances, and even light bulbs can connect to the Internet to exchange data and offer smart functionalities.

## The Structure of The Modern Internet

The internet today works through a massive global network of optical fiber cables. In this animation, you can see how data typically flows between the different levels of Internet Service Providers (ISPs) in the modern internet. The optical fiber cables carry signals in the form of light. However, your laptop or mobile phone processes electrical signals. So how does this conversion of light to electrical signals happen? And more importantly, why is the internet structured the way it is today?

## History and Evolution of the Internet

Understanding the origin of the Internet will provide us with valuable insights into how it has grown to become the technology that it is today.

### Early Beginnings

The story of the internet begins in the late 1960s with the creation of **ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network)** by the U.S. Department of Defense. ARPANET was the first network to implement the protocol suite TCP/IP, which became the technical foundation of the modern internet. <!-- what other protocols are there since then? -->

### Birth of the World Wide Web

The next significant milestone came in 1989 when a British computer scientist named Tim Berners-Lee proposed a system that made the internet more accessible and useful. He called this system the **World Wide Web (WWW)**. It was a revolutionary development that allowed documents and pages to be linked using hyperlinks.

### Growth and Expansion

Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, the internet saw exponential growth. The advent of web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft's Internet Explorer made navigating the WWW easier for everyday users. This period also saw the rise of search engines like Google, which made finding information on the rapidly expanding web much simpler.

### The Modern Internet

Today, the internet continues to evolve at a rapid pace. With advancements in cloud computing, the Internet of Things (IoT), and artificial intelligence, our world is becoming increasingly connected. We now live in an era where we can access information, communicate with people across the globe, and perform countless tasks online, all thanks to the internet. <!-- Flag that there are threats as well. -->

## Understanding the Digital World

### What distinguishes hardware from software?

Hardware refers to the physical components of a computer system (e.g., the CPU, memory, and storage devices). Software, on the other hand, refers to the programs and data that run on the hardware, instructing it to perform certain tasks. All software is digital.

### How does the physical world compare to the virtual one?

Physical objects exist in the world independently of our perception.<!-- virtual world don't require our perception either right, at least mine is not needed to run a software online, right? --> They have weight, volume, texture, and color. Virtual objects, on the other hand, only exist within the realm of a computer system, but can simulate many properties of physical objects.

### What are Real, Augmented, and Virtual Realities?

**Real reality** is the world as we experience it through our senses. **Augmented reality** overlays digital information onto the real world, enhancing what we see, hear, feel, and smell. **Virtual reality**, meanwhile, is a fully immersive digital experience, where users can interact with a completely artificial environment.

### Key Terms in the Digital World 

In addition to the **cloud**, the **ether**, the **web**, **virtual space**, **code**, **wire**, and **wireless**, what other words and phrases can be linked to the digital world? What do these words and phrases indicate?

1. **Data**: This refers to distinct pieces of information, usually formatted in a special way. All software is made up of data.

2. **Internet**: This is a global network connecting millions of computers. More than 190 countries are linked into exchanges of data, news, and opinions. <!-- Which countries aren't? -->

3. **Servers**: These are computers or systems that manage access to a centralized resource or service in a network.

4. **Protocols**: These are sets of rules that dictate how data is transmitted over the internet.

5. **Cyberspace**: This term refers to the virtual computer world, and more specifically, is an electronic medium used to form a global computer network to facilitate online communication. <!-- how is this different to the term Internet? -->

These terms and many others like them help us understand and navigate the complex landscape of the digital world.

## 4. Physical Components of the Digital World

### Devices Hosting and Maintaining the Digital World 

In order to understand the digital world, it's important to recognize the physical devices that host and maintain it. These devices are often referred to as **hardware**. They include personal computers, servers, smartphones, routers, switches, and data centers. But what are these devices made of, and how do they work?

### Role of Semiconductors

Semiconductors play a crucial role in the functioning of digital devices. They are materials, like silicon, that partially conduct electricity.<!-- link Silicon Valley --> In digital devices, semiconductors form the basis of microchips, which are used to create transistors - the building blocks of all digital circuits.

### Connection to Digital Libraries

Digital libraries store and provide access to large amounts of information in digital formats. They rely on hardware devices for their operation. For example, servers host the digital content, while network devices (like routers and switches) ensure that users can access this content over the internet. Moreover, users employ personal hardware devices (like computers or smartphones) to retrieve and interact with the digital content.<!-- have a figure for this -->

<br>

## 5. Energy Consumption and Environmental Impact

### Energy Usage in the Digital World 

The digital world is a significant consumer of energy. The main contributors to this energy consumption are:

- **Data Centers**: These are facilities that contain large amounts of servers and storage devices. They consume a lot of energy for their operation and cooling.<!-- cna I like the film Matrix to this?-->

- **Network Infrastructure**: This includes all the equipment necessary to provide internet connectivity, such as routers, switches, and transmission lines.

- **End-user Devices**: Personal computers, smartphones, and other digital devices also contribute to energy consumption.

### Carbon Footprint of the Digital World

The energy consumed by these components often comes from non-renewable sources<!--check-->, thereby contributing to carbon emissions and climate change. Moreover, the production and disposal of hardware devices also have an environmental impact, due to the use of non-renewable resources and the generation of electronic waste.<!--check-->

### Impact of Increasing Transistor Counts

The trend of increasing transistor counts in devices (known as Moore's Law) has led to more powerful and energy-efficient devices. However, it also means that devices become obsolete faster, leading to increased electronic waste. Furthermore, the manufacturing process of transistors is energy-intensive and has a significant carbon footprint.

### Looking Ahead: Sustainability in the Digital World

As we move forward, it becomes increasingly important to consider the environmental aspects of the digital world. Topics like energy-efficient computing, sustainable manufacturing practices, and e-waste management are becoming central to discussions about the future of technology.

<br>

## 6. Ownership and Control

#### Ownership of Digital Communication Components

The physical components of digital communication – such as servers, data centers, and network infrastructure – are typically owned by private companies. These include internet service providers (ISPs), telecommunications companies, and tech giants like Google and Amazon.

This ownership has significant implications. For instance, these entities can control what content is accessible, how fast data travels<!--how do they do that?-->, and how much it costs to access the internet. They also have a responsibility to protect the data that passes through their networks.

#### Role of the European Network and Information Systems Agency (ENISA)

ENISA plays a crucial role in regulating access to these components within the European Union. The agency works to ensure a high level of network and information security across the EU. This includes setting standards for cybersecurity, providing guidance on best practices, and coordinating responses to major cyber threats.<!--but?-->

#### Link to Cyber Crime and Darknet

The control over physical infrastructure also has a direct impact on cybersecurity. For example, if an entity with malicious intent gains control over a part of the infrastructure, they could potentially intercept or manipulate data. This ties in with the "Cyber Crime and Darknet" presentation, highlighting the importance of robust cybersecurity measures in protecting digital communication systems.<!-- add link later -->

<br>

## 7. Risks and Threats

### Potential Risks to Underwater Cables

Underwater cables, which carry the majority of the world's data, face a variety of risks. These include:

- **Human Accidents:** Ships' anchors and fishing activities can accidentally damage these cables. Construction or drilling projects near the coastlines can also pose a risk.

- **Natural Events:** Earthquakes, tsunamis, and landslides under the sea can disrupt or damage the cables. Marine life, such as sharks, have been known to bite cables, causing damage.

Several incidents in the past highlight these risks:

- In 2006, an earthquake off the coast of Taiwan disrupted several undersea internet cables, significantly affecting internet access in Asia.
  
- In 2008, damaged undersea cables in the Mediterranean disrupted internet service in parts of the Middle East and India.
  
- In 2013, three scuba divers were arrested off the coast of Egypt for attempting to cut through an undersea cable, which could have severely disrupted internet services.

<br>

## 8. Surveillance and Privacy

### Evolution of Surveillance

Surveillance has evolved significantly over the years:

- **Traditional Methods:** Originally, surveillance was conducted through physical means such as post, mail, and phone monitoring. These methods, while effective, were labor-intensive and time-consuming.

- **Digital Methods:** With the advent of the internet, surveillance has shifted to digital platforms. Emails, internet browsing history, and social media accounts can now be monitored more efficiently and on a much larger scale.

### Role of Data Centers and Servers

Data centers play a critical role in this digital infrastructure. They house servers that store and process vast amounts of data. Every click, every search, every post we make is stored and processed in these servers.

### Geolocation of Data Centers

The location of data centers can have significant implications:

- **User Experience:** A data center located closer to the user can provide faster data access and better service.

- **Legal Aspects:** Different countries have different laws regarding data privacy and surveillance. The location of the data center can affect which laws apply to the data stored there.

### Connection to "Artificial Intelligence and Big Data" 

In the context of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Big Data, this digital infrastructure facilitates massive data collection and analysis. Our online activities generate data that feeds into AI algorithms, enabling them to learn and improve. However, this also raises important questions about privacy and the extent of surveillance that is acceptable in our society.
