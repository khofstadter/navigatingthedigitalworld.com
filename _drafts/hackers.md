- hackers can be good and bad (and there is a grey area)
- historically hackers were associated with 'good' 
- examples: MIT hackers
  - break things (analysis)
  - build tho make them better (synthesis)
    - essentially experimenting (quick feedback)
- hackers
  - worked in groups
  - did pranks
  - Hackers (book) by Steve Levy
    - ethics:
      - universal access to tech (network, computers and internet)
      - breaking things is a good lesson
      - should be independent of race, age, gender
      - it should be beautiful

Problem (1980s)
- unauthorized access (for crime purposes)
- activism (hacktivism)
- Aaron Schwartz (suicide) he accessed JSTOR and downloaded files
- Mastodon (Fediverse) - alternative to X/Twitter
- NFT
- this is linked cables being laid down between countries
- MIT pranks are OK, but maybe not everywhere else
- Morris worm (MIT student) created a computer program that goes through the Internet (first virus?)
- powerful people (government) realized what this could be used for
- computer crime legislations are established in many countries 
- the law and new definition focus on the bad side of 'hackerism'

- white (discuss freedom and liberty)
- grey (could they be whistleblower e.g. E. Snowden, J.Asange)
- black (personal gain or for ideology), clearly criminal
- encryption is linked to surveillance (can be useful or overdone)
- pro/cons of open-source/paid software (does open-source mean good? How are developer paid? )
- Pegasus software was hacked
- haystack - they know what what Google does with your data?
