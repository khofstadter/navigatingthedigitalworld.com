## Literature
Haselby, Sam (2023) **The polycrisis: Is this the word we need to describe unprecedented convergences between ecological, political and economic strife?** Essay available on [AEON](https://aeon.co/essays/the-case-for-polycrisis-as-a-keyword-of-our-interconnected-times?utm_source=pocket-newtab-en-gb). After discussing definitions of the word ‘polycrisis’, the essay states that the polycrisis is created by our worlds being interconnected and interdependent. Then it highlights how difficult it is to trust words; it says “words are wanton”.[^inconsistent-terms]  Towards the middle of the article, Sam finally starts defining what we should call the polycrisis with examples linked to CO2, global human-made mass, wild mammals, and extinction rate levels. Towards the end, he also used the words ‘quick’ (pandemic, war) and ‘slow’ (climate change) to classify a crisis. The emphasis of the article is on urgency, that the polycrisis need our immediate attention.

Schmachtenberger, Daniel (2023) **An introduction to the Metacrisis** at Stockholm Impact Week 2023. Video available on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/4kBoLVvoqVY?feature=shared). Daniel talks about ther metacrisis, AI, the effects of globalization after WWII, and more. His message is depressing, but he is perfectly fine with it. He wants you to start by feeling depressed. Not feeling depressed means you haven't recognized the "continued destruction of the sacred around us" (e.g., sex trafficking of children or factory farming of animals). He offers a silver lining: Don't wait for others to address issues; take action yourself, which will alleviate your depression. I think he used the "f" word only five times. Daniel is part of the [Consilience Project](https://consilienceproject.org/).

8000 Hours (2023) **What are the most pressing world problems?** In this article, the team at 8000 hours "aim to list issues where each additional person can have the most positive impact. [they] focus on problems that others neglect, which are solvable, and which are unusually big in scale, often because they could affect many future generations — such as existential risks." Available at [8000 hours``](https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/).

**Articles on Environmental Themes from Mainstream News Outlets**: [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/uk/environment), an extensive selection of regularly updated articles covering various environmental topics such as climate change, wildlife, energy, and pollution. The [BBC Future](https://www.bbc.com/future) explores a wide range of articles addressing environmental themes, including climate change, sustainability, and innovative solutions to global challenges.
