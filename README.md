## Log
2023-10-19 Revised password-management and your-website pages. Decided to keep the list (notes) form for seminars as they are more useful when talking to people than the written up prose. (Don't read sentences while presenting, especially when your audience can read them as well.) It would be best to write up the lists (notes) into prose after the seminars for students to have a better flow when they revisit the site (and for those who didn't make it to the class), but keep the lists (notes) in HTML comments for next year. This might also be useful for recontextualizing a page for another platform e.g. Medium.

2023-10-12 Refined digital-identities page and added missing files from previous repo.

2023-10-11 Refined template repository. In this repo, I added general info to home page, and refined the page for the overall CS220 file. Also updated the repository with `bundle update` via macOS Terminal.

2023-08-22 Installed Jekyll on macOS 13.5, cloned/forked (?) Just The Docs template via browser, cloned repo on localhost (laptop), installed missing Ruby gems separately with source being `https://gems.ruby-china.com` in the Gemfile, as bundle didn't work. More info in `notes\projects\ndw.md` in private repo.
