Spyros' research focuses on production with AI an Big Data.

AI, termed in 1956
- links top logic, complex systems, cybernetics, robotics 

Aristotle: living things as instruments
<!-- whose definitions are these below -->
1. robots could help us get rid of slaves. "Freedom from sin." <!-- what does this mean? -->
2. another type of AI is the 'Devine Guidance' like ChatGPT (check Ian Banks' The Player of Games')
The difference: robots to do chores (1) vs divine AI that governs us (2)

But, 
- self driving cars in 2024 are not as evolved as expected (Uber kills someone, Cruzer as well?)
- IBMs software they thought of using for health didn't work out <!-- what about other AI tools -->
- AI making clothes, harvesting fruit, helping with healthcare, working warehouses are still not as evolved as promised <!-- need to check -->
- AI can order new parts, tell use when to harvest crops, organizes peoples time, it is good for automation. 

Virtual vs real life
- in the virtual they are evolved; 
- but they didn't help much with manual jobs; 

Transformative AGI by 2040? <!-- what does 'transformative' mean here? -->

But then why the sudden hype linked to AI in the last few years?
- LLM with chat option
- they are mainly good to produce 'content'

Economy: 
- hospital, tuition, house prices are getting more expensive - isn't this where we should use AI and machines?
- toys, TV cheaper <!-- does this keep people 'brainwashed'? -->

In 2024, still no mechanical slaves nor omniscient masters. <!-- but if it can play Chess and Go well, it certainly could be used for economics, making things more efficiently or not? So, what is the problem? Are economics much more complicated because of more variables, because the model of our ordinary reality is more complex? -->

EU thinks about having the ingredients of the computer (where materials come from) on the label. <!-- this could help people make more informed decisions -->

Ecologic planning vs AI planning. <!-- ? -->

He says we can't even make conscious choices about what clothes we prefer? <!-- Really? -->

Questions
- Why is the module of reality not enough to do certain things with AI? But it's gettin better right? The more granular the data to more efficient the simulations will be. Isn't it one of the important things we humans need to do is 'ethically' create the model? And before define what ethical is e.g. what data do we use to define the term ethical/moral? 

- What about the hype around AI being a threat e.g. linked to Google, OpenAI wanting to keep things closed? 

Good teaching/learning should measure progress, individual progress.

- AI in warfare now?
- no need to worry about Terminators?

He even says that he is bias. 

OK, yes, probably it is more important to make sure robots, machines, AI can help us sort us more important needs (food, shelter, bottom of Maslow pyramid) than help us create more content on Netflix, etc. 

Are his claims true? 
- that AI hasn't helped much in healthcare?
- that robots can't pick strawberries?
