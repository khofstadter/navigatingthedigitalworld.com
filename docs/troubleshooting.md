## Where, when, and how to ask for help?
The same sequence can be used in-person, in an email, or via an online forum or group:

1. What are the keywords you need to describe your problem?
2. Try your best with the information provided in the help files/FAQ to solve your problem.
3. Use the keywords in relevant forums/groups to see whether anyone has had the same or similar problems earlier.
4. Ask a question (be concise and friendly):
   1. State the problem.
   2. State what you have done (e.g., searched the forum but didn't find anything helpful).
