Some suggestions, from the [Net](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=password+best+practices+2022&t=brave&ia=web):

**don't** use

- words that can be found in dictionaries e.g. 'Lemon' or 'love'
- simple passwords e.g. '12345', 'aaaaaa' or '1234abcd'
- words that could be guessed from your social media profiles e.g. your dog's name
- the same password on different websites e.g. on Facebook and Twitter
- context-specific words e.g. 'instagram-ILOVEyou' on Instagram
- physical notebooks to store your passwords, software or online folders

**use**

- at least eight characters (but ideally more)
- longer instead of more complex passwords e.g. `correcthorsebatterystaple` is better than `Tr0ub4dor&3` (REF [1](https://securityboulevard.com/2021/03/nist-password-guidelines-2021-challenging-traditional-password-management/), [2](https://xkcd.com/936/))
- a good password manager app with a good password
- a mix of characters: 
  - capital letters e.g. 'C' (not as the first letter in your password as it is too common)
  - lower case letters e.g. 'w'
  - numbers e.g. '75'
  - symbols e.g. '<', '+', '>'
- try a twist on a personal affirmation (e.g. dontevergiveupmyfriend!81-firstandlastcharacterofwebsite)

### thoughts
- 2021 recommendation on [Password Length & Complexity](https://youtu.be/k_9suKBtIOQ)
- complex and long passwords which don't use dictionary words are easy to forget
- a long password is still the best practice

### idea 1 (phrase+)
- a long and similar password for different websites, let's think:
1. goingtouniisgreatfunin2022
2. going2UniIZgreatfunin2022
3. going2UniIZgreatfunin2022 + something from the website

- Facebook: going2UniIZgreatfunin2022kf
- Essex: going2UniIZgreatfunin2022kfxe

### idea 2 (four random dictionary names)
correcthorsebatterystaple

- Facebook: correcthorsebatterystaple_kf
- Essex: correcthorsebatterystaple_xe

### Test Passwords
- check [howsecureismypassword.net](https://howsecureismypassword.net/)
- review this site [here](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=howsecureismypassword+spam&t=brave&ia=web)
- always do some check with google before using something e.g. with keywords like 'spam', 'scam', 'hack'

### issues I had
- some website/apps need capitals and/or number and/or symbols, some prevent you to use them
- an idea is to not create many accounts
