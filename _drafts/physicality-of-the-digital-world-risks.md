### Role of Semiconductors

Semiconductors play a crucial role in the functioning of digital devices. They are materials, like silicon, that partially conduct electricity. In digital devices, semiconductors form the basis of microchips, which are used to create transistors - the building blocks of all digital circuits.

#### The Connection to Mining and Mineral Shortages

The production of these crucial hardware components requires a variety of minerals and rare earth elements, many of which are mined under challenging conditions. For instance, silicon, gold, copper, and various rare earth elements are essential for making semiconductors, memory units, and power supply units.

However, these resources are not evenly distributed across the globe, leading to geopolitical tensions. Some countries have abundant reserves of certain minerals, giving them significant influence over global supply chains. This has led to concerns about mineral shortages, especially as demand for digital devices continues to grow.

Countries and companies are therefore investing heavily in sustainable mining practices and exploring alternatives to these scarce resources. This is aimed at ensuring a steady supply of the necessary minerals, reducing environmental impact, and mitigating potential geopolitical risks.

#### The Impact of Geopolitics on Hardware Production

Geopolitics plays a significant role in the production of digital device hardware. Trade policies, diplomatic relations, and even conflicts can affect the availability and cost of these essential minerals. As a result, fluctuations in international relations can directly impact the production, pricing, and availability of digital devices worldwide.



## Energy Consumption and Environmental Impact

### Energy Usage in the Digital World 

The digital world is a significant consumer of energy. The main contributors to this energy consumption are:

- **Data Centers**: These are facilities that contain large amounts of servers and storage devices. They consume a lot of energy for their operation and cooling.<!-- cna I like the film Matrix to this?-->

- **Network Infrastructure**: This includes all the equipment necessary to provide internet connectivity, such as routers, switches, and transmission lines.

- **End-user Devices**: Personal computers, smartphones, and other digital devices also contribute to energy consumption.

### Carbon Footprint of the Digital World

The energy consumed by these components often comes from non-renewable sources<!--check-->, thereby contributing to carbon emissions and climate change. Moreover, the production and disposal of hardware devices also have an environmental impact, due to the use of non-renewable resources and the generation of electronic waste.<!--check-->

### Impact of Increasing Transistor Counts

The trend of increasing transistor counts in devices (known as Moore's Law) has led to more powerful and energy-efficient devices. However, it also means that devices become obsolete faster, leading to increased electronic waste. Furthermore, the manufacturing process of transistors is energy-intensive and has a significant carbon footprint.

### Looking Ahead: Sustainability in the Digital World

As we move forward, it becomes increasingly important to consider the environmental aspects of the digital world. Topics like energy-efficient computing, sustainable manufacturing practices, and e-waste management are becoming central to discussions about the future of technology.

## Ownership and Control

#### Ownership of Digital Communication Components

The physical components of digital communication – such as servers, data centers, and network infrastructure – are typically owned by private companies. These include internet service providers (ISPs), telecommunications companies, and tech giants like Google and Amazon.

This ownership has significant implications. For instance, these entities can control what content is accessible, how fast data travels<!--how do they do that?-->, and how much it costs to access the internet. They also have a responsibility to protect the data that passes through their networks.

#### Role of the European Network and Information Systems Agency (ENISA)

ENISA plays a crucial role in regulating access to these components within the European Union. The agency works to ensure a high level of network and information security across the EU. This includes setting standards for cybersecurity, providing guidance on best practices, and coordinating responses to major cyber threats.<!--but?-->

#### Link to Cyber Crime and Darknet

The control over physical infrastructure also has a direct impact on cybersecurity. For example, if an entity with malicious intent gains control over a part of the infrastructure, they could potentially intercept or manipulate data. This ties in with the "Cyber Crime and Darknet" presentation, highlighting the importance of robust cybersecurity measures in protecting digital communication systems.<!-- add link later -->

## Risks and Threats

### Potential Risks to Underwater Cables

Underwater cables, which carry the majority of the world's data, face a variety of risks. These include:

- **Human Accidents:** Ships' anchors and fishing activities can accidentally damage these cables. Construction or drilling projects near the coastlines can also pose a risk.

- **Natural Events:** Earthquakes, tsunamis, and landslides under the sea can disrupt or damage the cables. Marine life, such as sharks, have been known to bite cables, causing damage.

Several incidents in the past highlight these risks:

- In 2006, an earthquake off the coast of Taiwan disrupted several undersea internet cables, significantly affecting internet access in Asia.
  
- In 2008, damaged undersea cables in the Mediterranean disrupted internet service in parts of the Middle East and India.
  
- In 2013, three scuba divers were arrested off the coast of Egypt for attempting to cut through an undersea cable, which could have severely disrupted internet services.

## Surveillance and Privacy

### Evolution of Surveillance

Surveillance has evolved significantly over the years:

- **Traditional Methods:** Originally, surveillance was conducted through physical means such as post, mail, and phone monitoring. These methods, while effective, were labor-intensive and time-consuming.

- **Digital Methods:** With the advent of the internet, surveillance has shifted to digital platforms. Emails, internet browsing history, and social media accounts can now be monitored more efficiently and on a much larger scale.

### Role of Data Centers and Servers

Data centers play a critical role in this digital infrastructure. They house servers that store and process vast amounts of data. Every click, every search, every post we make is stored and processed in these servers.

### Geolocation of Data Centers

The location of data centers can have significant implications:

- **User Experience:** A data center located closer to the user can provide faster data access and better service.

- **Legal Aspects:** Different countries have different laws regarding data privacy and surveillance. The location of the data center can affect which laws apply to the data stored there.

### Connection to "Artificial Intelligence and Big Data" 

In the context of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Big Data, this digital infrastructure facilitates massive data collection and analysis. Our online activities generate data that feeds into AI algorithms, enabling them to learn and improve. However, this also raises important questions about privacy and the extent of surveillance that is acceptable in our society.
